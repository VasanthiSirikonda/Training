- JavaScript
- Ajax
- TypeScript
- CSS
- DOM


- Threadpool
- Synchrounous and Asynchronous
- DB locking

Synchrounous and Asynchronous:
--------------------------------
- Synchrounous
	- Sending a bow line by line
	- My first request's response is input to the second request, then we use synchoronous
	- Disadv
		- Time consuming
		- Waiting time for getting response is more
- Asynchronous
	- Sending multiple requests without considering the responses
	- Cartoon Network-->uses Ascynchronous 
		- uses 24 frames
	- There is no waiting time
	- Adv
		- consumes less time
	- Disadv
		- Data may lost 
		- Data Integrity should be in consistent state
			- It is inconsistent
	- Composite Microservices
		- Networking		
		- Microservices
	
THREAD:
-------
- For performing the multiple tasks at a time we need thread
- thread is under the control of processor which is a h/w
- processor(h/w)----->OS--->process-->threads
- Every processor has memory
- works on Asynchronous mode.
- every processor can have any no. of child threads.
	- Based on the memory size of process we can create threads
- Process creation is heavy weight -- difficult
- Threads creation is light weight -- very easy 
- 2 types
	- Predefined
		- Under the control of JVM
	- Userdefined
		- Under the control of developer
- Thread can be created in 2 ways
	- Using extends thread
	- Implements runnable
		- also called functional interface
			- an interface with only one abstract method.
- Once the session is created to db, one thread is created.
- Any class which has main method --> called as main thread	
- Daemon Threads	
	- threads which are running in the backend
	- also called as background threads
	- Daemon-->Disk and Execution Monitor
- Threads can be assigned will priorities like
	- High
	- Low --> there is guarentee that they will run on time and for sure.
	- Medium
	- Normal=5
	  Min=1
	  max=10
- All the threads are under the control of objects
- methods ===> sleep, notify, notifyall and wait
- Wherever the tx--> ther is a thread
- No two process can have same processid
- Threadpool	
	- Is a pool of thread objects which can be configured as a dynamic pool or fixed pool
	- Controlled by thread executor or executor class
	- Pool shouldnt exceed the capacity of the processor
- Reflection or Introspection in java
	- ability to fetch a metadata of a class is called  Reflection or Introspection in java
	- used to display nonstatic methods also
		- sops
		
		
class MyExample extends Thread
{
	public void display()
	{
		
		System.out.println(this.getState());
	}
}
 
public class ThreadExample1 {
	
	public static void main(String...a)
	{
		try {
			Thread.sleep(8876);
		} catch (InterruptedException e) {
			// TODO Auto-generated catch block
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		new MyExample().display();
	}
 
}


	
LOCKING:
--------
- If one thread is utilizing/accessing the resource, other should wait--locking
- If 2 threads want to access/modify the same resource-- it leads to deadlock/race condition
	- it violates ACID properties and integrity issues if we are using dbs
	- leads to dirty reads and phantom reads
- 2 types of locking mechanisms for db
	- Optimistic
		- 
		
		
	- Pessimistic
		- 
		
- helps you to avoid dirtyreads and phantom reads in the projects.
	
Note:
-----
- By default, Springboot/Spring is synchoronous
	- By adding @Async , it will be Ascynchronous
	- For restfull services, we need to use Ascynchronous
- Commit & Flush
	- both do same works	
	- Commit:
		Once commit is given, the data is pushed to db
	- Flush:
		- Once flush is given, the data is pushed to session object and then to db.
	- When you call session.flush(), the statements are executed in database but it will not committed.
		- If you don’t call session.flush() and if you call session.commit() , internally commit() method executes the statement and commits.
	- commit()= flush+commit.
 - Multi-Threading
	- We have locking mechanism  
	
HTML IN ECLIPSE:
----------------
1) file-->new-->static web project-->name your project->finish
2) for running--> click on run on server--> basic-->http server

TASK:
-----
placeholder in html
date picker
Drop downlist---Single and Multiselect
submit vs button tag
html validations----required
image-
audio and video using html---manual controll and automatic control----audio/video control
flash screen--discount image
horizontal bar and vertical bar
frames in html

JAVASCRIPT:
----------
- Java and JavaScript are different.
- JavaScript is a Object based Scripting language used to design dynamic web pages.
- We can design even mobile applications usings JavaScript languages.
	- Eg: Kony Mobile Framework
		- it can convert into 32 OS
	- Eg:Phonegap
- Webservice can also be created using JavaScript and some 3rd party libaries
- Disadv(ES8 can overcome some of the below )
	- JS is not secure
		- Can be handled by using JSON tokens and other security mechanisms
	- Doesnt support all OOPS features
		- Can be handled by Upgrade your JS to ES7 or ES8 version
	- Multithreading is not supported
		- Can be handled by integrating JS with NodeJs 
	- Doesnt support NIO Operations
		- Can be handled by integrating JS with NodeJs
	- Cant create n/w based apps
		-Can be handled by integrating JS with NodeJs
	- JS doesnt support dbs directly
		- db operations==>CURD operations
		- Can be handled by integrating JS with NodeJs
	- JS doesnt support desktop apps development
- Before JavaScript, we have lua
	- lua is a scripting language
	- but it wont work for all types of platforms
		- as it is platform dependent
- JavaScript is platform independent
- But now, lua is a compitetor for JavaScript
	- Market trend is JavaScript only
- extension==> ".js"
- In java -- JVM, In JavaScript--JavaScript VMs--browser
- Every browser will have inbuilt javascript engine which takes the responsibility of running your script code
	- Chrome---V8 engine==>mainly it is used for ReactJS
	- IE/Edge---Chakra
	- Rhino,JavaScriptCore(Nitro)----Safari
	- Firefox--- SpiderMonkey
- JS follows ECMA standars
	- European Computer Manufacturers Association
- Versions of JS
	- ES5,ES6,ES7,ES8
	- ES6 is best for learning
- JS engine designed in C/C++
- JVM cdesigned in C/C++
- For frontend 
	- ReactJS,Reactnative,Angular,Backbone,VueJS...etc
		- The above framework uses NodeJS capabilities to perform Scaffolding and for writing/running the code
- For dependency management
	- In Java, we use Maven
	- In JS, we use NPM(Node Package Manager)
		- NPM is a part of NodeJs
	- To create a corporate repo, we use Nexus Sonatype or JFrog.
- For Code quality testing for JS-- Sonarqube
- IDE--- VS Code
- For Unit testing
	- In java--> JUnit
	- In JS---> Protractor
- JS is Ascynchronous
	- Because JS is single threaded
- Ways to run JS code	
	- Using browser console
	- IDE is like VSCode, ECLIPSE
	- Create a Html file with JS Code as inline
	- Using JS playground
		- JSFiddle(online Editor==>cloud environment)
		- Not secure
		- Meant for running the JS code on cloud directly
		- It can run Html and CSS code also
	- Using NodeJs 
- Best brwser to run JS ==> Internet Explorer
- No datatypes in JS.
	- Syntax: var <var_name>
- Syntax for Function:
	- There are 8 ways to create JS Functions
		- Traditional way
		  Function <function_name>
		  {
			//body
		  }
- Compatible testing
	- http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:arrow_function_syntax
	- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#browser_compatibility

- Can we run JS without browser?
	- Using NodeJs
		- becoz it have V8 engine in built.
- JS supports few collections
	- like Array,List
- For CI/CD server
	- we use Jenkins/Team City
- Browser testing--selenium
- Base Object-->Window
- NodeJs
	- Opensouce
	- Built on V8
	- meant for JS
	- we cant directly use NodeJs in java---indirectly can be used
	- It is jst a platform to overcome the disadv in JS
	- JS framework or environment
- Always write your JS code in head tag of HTML
	<html>
		<head>
			<title>Java Script</title>
		<script>
			document.write("Hi JavaScript!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!")
		</script>
		</head>
	<body>
	</body>
	</html>
- alert("JavaScript"); // outdated feature instead popups are used
- becarefull while using "eval"
Note:
------
- C can be run on
	- Turbo C/Turbo C++/Borland C++/GC++ by linux/VC++ by Microsoft
- C++ then C thrn java for embedded system 
- PegaSys
	- purely C++
	- Iseral scam
	- Testing weapons like AK47..
- Console.log ==> similarly like sops
	- Not recommended to use multipletimes
	- available in browser-->inspect-->console
	- Used display the output in console
- document.write()
	- Used display output in browser
- Can java to JS communication possible?
	- Java had a JS package-->Rhino as a JS Engine
	- DWR(Direct Web Remoting) framework is used for java to JS and vice-versa communication
		- https://docs.huihoo.com/dwr/DWR.pdf
		- 3rd paty library
- LWS(Lager Web Screens)
	- Airports, malls

- If any browser is not supporting Htm5 feature on specific versions of browser
	- then we need to use "POLYFILLS"
	- POLYFILLS gives work around/ code which can work on older versions
	- POLYFILLS for IE2--not available
	- POLYFILLS is a set of JS program/instructions provided by 3rd party vendor to achieve
		a specific requirement on specified version
	- We need to download a specific feature that is not available in particular browser 
		- Eg:abcd feature in particular browser needs to be downloaded
		
JS:
---
<!-- var a=10;-->
	var b=20;
	var c=["Vasanthi",123];
	var d=[];<!-- for array we use "[]" -->
	document.write(c);
	document.write(a+b);
	
	d.push(45);	<!-- to push a value into array which is predefined -->
	c.pop(123);  <!-- pop the element from existing array -->
	document.write(c);
	document.write(d);
	document.write("Hi JavaScript!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!")
	alert("JavaScript");  <!-- outdated feature instead popups are used -->-->

O/P: 4,8,16,20,24,36,0

DOM(Document Object Model):
---------------------------
- Window---Document---Form
- Using DOM	
	- Can do validations ---> JS comeup with "JS DOM API"
	- We can change values of the components dynamically.
- whenver we load a page into browser	
	- browser will create a DOM structure in the backend
- DOM is available for html and xml
	- but not for JSON

- Methods of DOM API
	- document.getElementById()
	- document.getElementsByName()
	- document.getElementsByClass()
- If you want access the components/widgets in a webpage 
	- we cn use JS DOM API


Note:
-------
- 	"=" -->assigning values
	"==" ---> comparing values
	"===" ---> Compares values and datatypes

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String

- whenever there are multiple counters-- leads to dirty reads


@Async in SpringBoot:
----------------------
- wherever there is a @Async, we use CompletableFuture
- return type is CompletableFuture
- flow of Async 
	- Front Controller-->Custom Controller--->Service
		- async methods-- execute logic in async mode--custom methods shld return completableFuture obj to controller
	
	
The @EnableAsync annotation switches on Spring’s ability to run @Async methods in a background thread pool.


TYPESCRIPT:
-----------
- Similarly like java
- Competitor to JS
- For defining constants
	- In java, we use "final"
	- In TypeScript, we use "const"



TASKS:
-------
- SPA
- can i disable js in browser








**********************************************************************

JAVASCRIPT:
--------------
- It is a high level,interpreted language used to make webpages more interactive.
- 1995
- Used for the look alive of webpages by adding motion to it
-  Used in
	- Web applications
	- Smart Watches
	- Games
	- Websites
- Where can we run JS
	- Console
		- Using console.log()
	- VSCode
- Benefits of JS
	- Easy to learn and simple to implement
	- Weak type programming language
		- Which doent have any strict rules for coding
	- Fast
		- As it is clientside programming language
			- It doent need to contact with the servers and ait for the response
			
	- Platform Independent
	- Rich Framework
		- Angular JS
		- ReactJS
	- Interactive Websites
- IDE environments
	- VSCode
	- Sublime text
	- Atom
	
Fundamentals of JS:
---------------------
1) Variables
	- Holds data value and it can be changed anytime
	- It uses a reserved keyword "var" to declare a variable
	- Rules 
		- Cnat be a reserved keyword
		- meaningful name
		- Cant start with number
		- No spaces or hyphen
		- Case sensitive

2) Constants
	- Once constant is declared, it cant be modified or assigned a new value
	
3) Datatypes
	- data that can be used and manipulated in a pgm.
	- In JS, we have 2 dkinds of data: 
		- Primitives
		- Objects
- 2 Type
	- Primitive or Value types
		- Numbers
		- Strings
		- Boolean
		- Undefined
		- Null
	- Reference types
		- We have objects
		- Eg:How to create obj 
			let girl={
			name:'chakri',
			age:23
			};
		- How to change the name of a object
			- Using Dot notation
				- girl.name='Sirikonda';
			- Using bracket notation
				- girl['name']='Sam';
- To check the type of the var ==> use "typeof"	

4) Arrays in JS:
-----------------
- Js Array obj is a global obj
	- Used in construction of arrays,which are high level and list-like objects.
	
Eg:
---
//arrays in js
let items=['color','paintbrush','plate'];
items[3]='spray';
items[4]=100;
console.log(items);
console.log(items[3]);
console.log(items.length);
console.log(items.pop());--->removes the last element
console.log(items.push());--->add the element to array
console.log(items.reverse());---->the last element will print first in the array list
console.log(items.shift());----> removes the first value and prints that value
console.log(items.toString());----->converts all the elements into strings in the array
console.log(items.unshift());------> adds the elements and returns the no. of elements in the array
console.log(items.join());-----> same as "toString()",joins them into a string

5)  Functions in JS:
--------------------
- It is a subpgm designed to perform a particular task
- Values can be passed into fns and used within the fn.
- 2 types
	- Predefined
	- User Defined 
Eg:
---
//functions in js
function view(name){
    console.log('Welcome to Infinite'+' '+name);
}
view('Computer Solutions');


6) Conditional Statements in JS:
---------------------------------

//conditional stmt=>if in js
let  number=[];
number=[1,3,4,5,2,4,0];
if(number[2]==number[5])
{
    console.log("yes");
}

//conditional stmt=>if-else in js
let  number=[];
number=[1,3,4,5,2,4,0];
if(number[2]==number[4])
{
    console.log("yes");
}
else{
    console.log("No")
}

7) Loops:
-----------
- While Loop:
	- //while loops in js
		let i=0;
		while(i<5){
		console.log("number is"+ i);
		i++;
		}

- DoWhile loop:
	- //Dowhile loop in js
		let j=0;
		do{
		console.log("number is"+ j);
		j++;
	}
	while(j<6);

- For Loop
	- //for loop on js
		for(let k=0;k<5;k++){
		console.log("Num:"+k);
		}
	-  eg-2 
		var itr;
		var characteristic={first:"Name", second:"Age", third:"eye-color",fourth:"height"};
		for(itr in characteristic)
		console.log(characteristic[itr]);

8) Switch Statement:
---------------------
//switch stmt in js
let game="cricket";
switch(game){
    case "football":
        console.log("I dont want to watch football");
        break;
    case "Hockey":
        console.log("I dont play hockey");
        break;
    case "cricket":
        console.log("I love to play cricket");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("match not found");
}


JS SubString:
-------------
- It is a subset of another string
- It is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
- Syntax:
	//JS substring
	String.substring(index A, [index B]);
- Substring method and length property are used to extract the last character of your paticular string.
	- //length of the string and subtring method
		var string1="Infinite";
		var string2= string1.substring(string1.length-5);
		console.log(string2);

Substring Vs Substr Vs Slice:
-----------------------------
- All the methods are used to extract the parts of the string  and return the extracted parts in a new string.
- Substring:
	- Returns the part of the string b/w startindex and endindex
	- It excludes the endindex character or up to the end of the string.
	
- Substr:
	- Returns part of the string starting from an index 
		and no. of characters after the start index.
	- It has 2 parameters 
		- startIndex
		- Length

- Slice	
	- Similar to substring
	- It returns partial string b/w start index and end index
	- It excludes end index character or 
		up to the end of the string if end index not provided.


Predefined Functions in JS:
----------------------------
- Eval
	- Evaluates a string and returns a value
- ParseInt
	- Parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix or base
- ParseFloat
	- Parse a string argument and returns a floating point number
- Escape
	- Returns the hexadecimal encoding of an argument
-Unescape
	- Returns the ASCII string for the specified value.



JavaScript Regex/Regular Expressions in JS:
---------------------------------------------
- It is a sequenceof characters that constructs a search pattern.
- Syntax:
	var <varname> = new RegExp(pattern,attributes);
	              or
	var <varname> = /pattern/attributes;
	
Modifiers:
----------
- Used to perform any case insensitive or global searches in JS.
- 3 different modifiers
	- g modifier
		- It performs any sort of global match in our string
		- Eg: Suppose you are looking for a word in a string
			- This g-modifier searches globally and finds that particular word.
		- Eg:
			var str="welcome to infinite computer solutions";
			var part1= /to/g;
			
	- i modifier
		- It performs case-insensitive matching
		- Eg: Suppose you have a word which contains both upper and lower case letters
			- This i-modifier performs case insensitve matching
	
	- m modifier
		- It performs multiline matching
		- Eg: If you have 3 or more lines in a string  
			- This m-modifier searches the particular or charcter in those lines present in string
